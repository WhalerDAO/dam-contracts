# TREE v1.1

### Summary
After TREE was deployed, we quickly found that the short interval between rebalances harmed TREE holders and distributed more profits to arb bots than to charity. We had to "trick" our reserve to send the $176k worth of DAI to an [intermediary wallet](TODO: link to reserve1.1), where it will remain until TREE v2 is launched.
